iNA (0.4.0);

  * A parameter scan of the steady state, allowing to analyze the dependence of the steady state
    from model parameters.
  * Improved usability of iNA, including an improved equation rendering and ploting.
  * Model editing capabilities.

iNA (0.3.1);

  * The Inverse Omega Squared analysis (IOS) which yields more accurate noise estimates than the
    Linear Noise Approximation. At the same time it predicts the average concentrations more
    accurate than the EMREs.
  * Just-in-time compilation based on the LLVM framework delivering high performance to iNA's
    analyses.
  * Support for the efficient ODE integrator LSODA for our time course analysis.
  * A very robust steady state solver which uses a combination of the fast Newton-Raphson method
    and the reliable ODE integrator LSODA.
  * Support for even more SBML features such as constant species and automatic conversion of
    reversible reactions into irreversible ones.

This page offers a list of platforms supported by iNA. As we are unable to test iNA on every platforms we intend to support. You can help us to keep this page up-to-date by [reporting](http://code.google.com/p/intrinsic-noise-analyzer/issues/entry) problems you encountered using iNA. Please let us also know if iNA runs perfectly on a platform that is marked as _untested_.

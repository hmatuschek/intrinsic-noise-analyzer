Such fluctuations, also known as intrinsic noise, arise due to the stochastic nature of chemical reactions and cannot be ignored when some molecules are present in very low copy numbers only, as is the case in living cells. The SBML-based software computes statistical measures such as means and standard deviations of concentrations within a given accuracy. This is carried out automatically using the system size expansion whose leading order term is the popular Linear Noise Approximation. The results of the analysis can be tested against the computationally much more expensive stochastic simulation algorithm.} maintainers gmail.com:hmatuschek license GPL-2 categories science version 0.4.1 revision 0

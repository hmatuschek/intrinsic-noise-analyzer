description The intrinsic noise analyzer for biochemical reaction networks.
long_description iNA is a computational tool for quantitative analysis of fluctuations in \
  biochemical reaction networks. Such fluctuations, also known as intrinsic noise, arise due to \
  the stochastic nature of chemical reactions and cannot be ignored when some molecules are \
  present in very low copy numbers only, as is the case in living cells. The SBML-based software \
  computes statistical measures such as means and standard deviations of concentrations within a \
  given accuracy. This is carried out automatically using the system size expansion whose leading \
  order term is the popular Linear Noise Approximation. The results of the analysis can be tested \
  against the computationally much more expensive stochastic simulation algorithm.
